# DS-DBScan_Wine

# Problem Statement


# Identifying the best quality wine is a special skill and very few experts are specialized in accurately detecting the quality.
# The objective of this project is to simplify the process of detecting the quality of wine.

# `CRISP-ML(Q)` process model describes six phases:
  1. Business and Data Understanding
  2. Data Preparation
  3. Model Building
  4. Evaluation
  5. Model Deployment
  6. Monitoring and Maintenance

 **Objective(s):** Minimize Shipment Organization Time
 
# **Constraints:** Minimize Specialists' Dependency    

# **Success Criteria**
# - Business Success Criteria : Reduce the time of wine quality check by anywhere between 20% to 40%
# - ML Success Criteria : Achieve Silhouette coefficient of atleast 0.5
# - Economic Success Criteria : Wine distillers will see an increase in revenues by atleast 20%

**Proposed Plan:**
# Grouping the available wines will allow to understand the characteristics of each group.

# Data Dictionary

# - OD_read: Amount of dilution in that particular wine type
# - Proline: Amount of Proline in that particular wine type, Proline is typically the most abundant amino acid present in grape juice and wine
